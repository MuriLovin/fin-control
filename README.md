# Finance Management API
This is a simple API for managing finances. It is built using [Go](https://go.dev/). The application is using [mysql](https://www.mysql.com/) as the database.
This project exists to understand the basics of building an API using Go and explore more about the core concepts of Go. Furthermore, my personal difficulties in managing finances inspired me to build this project and keep its more simple and easy to use.
